BioDRUMS
========

This project builds up on DRUMS. It extends it by parsers for HitFiles generated by [BLAST](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and SNPFiles from http://1001genomes.org. In addition, concrete implementations of the AbstractKVStorable class in [DRUMS](http://mgledi.github.io/DRUMS) are provided. Those are needed to store SNP data and HERV data. Furthermore, this project provides an extensivly documented read- and write-tutorial with example data. 

Please, see [DRUMS](http://mgledi.github.io/DRUMS) for details.
